# Trends in Web Development Lab 4

## Objective
Get used to the Angular environment and understanding more preprocessors.

## Description
This lab will explore Angularâ€™s master page (index.html) and master styling (styles.css). Using those files, we will start making a basic Angular page using just HTML and CSS. We will then be introduced to a CSS preprocessor, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Instructions
### Part 1: Basic CSS
Create a new Angular project or use an existing one. Inside the src folder, use index.html and styles.css to create the following navigation:
```
Link 1      Link 2      Link 3
Link 1a
Link 2a
Link 3a Sublink 3
        Sublink 3
        Sublink 3
```

When the user hovers over the links, a group of nested links will show. When each of those nested links is hovered, another group of nested links will show related to that nested link.
Once finished, commit these changes to a git repository.

-- Part 1 is located in Part1 branch.

### Part 2: Introduction to SASS
Using SASS, recreate what was made in Part 1. Compare and contrast between the two. Which one do you prefer? Commit these changes to same repository as above.

-- Part 2 is located in Part2 branch.
